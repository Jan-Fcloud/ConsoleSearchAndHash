# ConsoleSearchAndHash
It's a very simple C# Console program that searches a given directory and it's subdirectories for files that contain the provided filter. It also displays the file hash incase it's needed.

# Why
I made it cause I was testing something for an idea I got + Windows Explorer refused to find files that were clearly there annoying me with the constant "No items match your search." response.

A portion of the code will be used in something else but I put this here cause:
  - a) I will need this for some point in time,
  - b) Maybe others will need it, idk.

It's here and just take it if you need it, even though I highly doubt it.
